CRITICAL: Make today_action EXTREMELY specific with ready-to-use copy-paste content. No research tasks, no "figure out" instructions. Give them exactly what to do, say, and where to go.

FORMATTING: Structure today_action with clear time blocks and line breaks using \\n for readability.

For each idea include:
- name (creative, specific business name)  
- description (compelling 3-4 sentences)
- startup_cost (like "$47")
- difficulty ("‚≠ê" to "‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê")
- feasibility_score ("X.X/10") 
- timeline ("5-8 days")
- today_action (SPECIFIC 2-hour action plan formatted with \\n line breaks. Include EXACT copy-paste templates, specific websites, exact messages to send, precise pricing recommendations. Structure as: TIME: ACTION with ready-to-use content. NO research tasks - provide the actual content they need.)
- success_example (specific, unique story with name, amount earned, and timeframe)

Example formatting for today_action:
"üïô 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM: Sign up at fiverr.com\\n‚Ä¢ Create gig: 'I will write compelling product descriptions that sell'\\n‚Ä¢ Set price: $15\\n‚Ä¢ Use this exact description: 'Get product descriptions that convert browsers into buyers.
